	        		<p>I study Computer Science (Games) at the University of Southern California. I love to make games as much as I love to play them. Currently working on Lantern, a USC Advanced Games Project. </p>

	        <h2>LANTERN</h2>
	        <d>(Unreal Engine 4) Summer 2017 - Now: lead engineer</d>
	        <p><iframe width="490" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZXtjfBxWuM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
	        <p><li>Created the original prototype version of Lantern as a solo engineer as a proof of concept to pass the competitive USC AGP judging process
	        <li>Managed a 6-person engineering team in a 25-person team to create a virtual reality puzzle game for the Oculus Rift, under the USC AGP program.
	        <li>Planned and assigned weekly tasks to all engineers (including myself) in a way that optimized efficiency by analyzing the strengths/weaknesses of engineers and prevented burnout by alternating between features/polish. 
	        <li>Planned and created a virtual reality toolkit from the ground up, that handled everything from basic interactions to hand gestures/animations, to meet the specific needs of a haptic VR puzzle game.
	        <li>Naturally a very 3D math heavy game, since virtual reality gives us raw 3D world locations/rotations as opposed to traditional boolean or 1D inputs.

	        <p><li>Programmed all animations, created the trailer, and split game design and programming duties as part of a 2-person team that created a top-down four-player couch multiplayer arena brawler game featuring item-based combat.

	        <li>Programmed a character select screen where up to 4 players could navigate and lock in their heroes.</p>

	        <li>Implemented various features ranging from interactions/animations/movement/collision/comfort/debug visualizations.

	        <d1><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSe6DXiS11g">YouTube</a></d1>
	        <p><li>Developed a pinball game with a twist: the player possesses the abilities of Soldier: 76 from Overwatch, a popular first-person shooter game.
	        <li>Rocket jumping and shooting aren't things that are normally in pinball games, so a lot of people had trouble playing my game at first.</p>

	        <d1><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29slsJKSYFg&feature=youtu.be">YouTube</a></d1>
	        <p><li>Collaborated on a 3-person team to design core gameplay for a 3D third-person action platformer. Created and programmed all animations as well as various weapons and systems in the game.
	        <li>I'm most proud of the crisp melee, umbrella, and pogo stick systems that I also paired with my animations. UE4 makes it really simple to create events off of certain frames, for stuff like enabling/disabling the attack hitbox or umbrella reflection mode. I didn't have to keep track of timers manually which was really nice.

	        <d1><br><a href="https://kitchenstrikegame.blogspot.com/">(Backed up) Website</a></d1>
	        <p><li>Worked on an online multiplayer shooter game in which each team owns its own restaurant. Each team attempts to pay rent by the end of the day via operating their restaurant, but they also seek to bankrupt the other team's restaurant through sabotage or combat.<li>It's supposed to be a realistic restaurant simulator where the player has to either manually perform all the duties of a restaurant (cooking, serving, cleaning) or at least hire an NPC to do it for them. At the same time you can mess with the opposing restaurants through knocking down their trash cans, breaking their equipment, or by simply attacking their players/employees. I never got to finish this project, but I released a playable version by the end of the summer. </p>
